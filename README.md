## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Leaflet Library

### What I learned

Learned how to hide API keys and deploy site on vercel. Additionally, learned how to integrate Leaflet library.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

The current design is not suitable for mobile screens. I plan to remake this site with a more accessible design in future.

### Useful resources

- [Hiding API Keys in Javascript Netlify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J3xbMkH2K4) - This helped with hiding the API key from github. I modified it to make it work for vercel. **Note: API key can still be seen using developer tools.**
- [ipgeolocation API](https://ipgeolocation.io) - I'm using this API to fetch the data as this provides better free options than ipify.
